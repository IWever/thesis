\subsection{Physical models}

\subsubsection{Manoeuvrability}
How does the inertia of ship work, and movements due to props and rudder.

Abkowitz defined in 1964 a simple model where position (X, Y) and rotation (N) depends on speed, accelation and rudder angles. Including hydrodynamic forces and moments. This is needed to calculate the path. 

\subsubsection{Environmental forces}
How are we going to model the wind, wave and current forces

\subsection{Route planning}
What are key issues in optimizing the route

\subsection{Cost function}
