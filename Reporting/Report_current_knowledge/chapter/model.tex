\section{Physical models}

\subsection{Manoeuvrability}
How does the inertia of ship work, and movements due to props and rudder.

Abkowitz defined in 1964 a simple model where position (X, Y) and rotation (N) depends on speed, accelation and rudder angles. Including hydrodynamic forces and moments. This is needed to calculate the path. 

\subsection{Environmental forces}
How are we going to model the wind, wave and current forces

\section{Route planning}
What are key issues in optimizing the route
Model predictive control - Tor Arne Johansen

\section{Cost function}

\section{Monitoring}
\subsection{Ship}

\subsection{Environment}
what is the consequence if there is no AIS available, which other methods are there to warn for hazards like that?
