\section{Desired result}
With the knowledge from the previous chapters a framework can be formed for my research. Hereby taken into account what has already been done and how this can be used. To have a goal the result of will be defined upfront. 
This result can be separated into two parts too. The first part is for the department of Maritime Technology and Transport. Where I will try to specify a scale for the complexity of a situation, which is correlated with te probability of failure. As a white box 

The second part of the research will be for the Interactive Intelligence department of computer science.
