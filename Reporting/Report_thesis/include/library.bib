abstract = {A number of recent large-ship accidents have compelled naval architects and engineers to advance the research on ship maneuverability and the prediction of ship response in the ocean environment. In the meantime, new maneuverability standards have been developed and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has also proposed one such standard. This standard provides four ship-maneuvering performance criteria, and its latest version is dated December 2002. Simulation technology, in particular the simulation of ship maneuvering, has advanced considerably in recent years with the advent of computers. Computer programs using either numerically computed or experimentally determined hydrodynamics coefficients have allowed an accurate simulation of ship maneuverability for different types of vessels. Relatively good agreement has been reported by various researchers between simulated results and those obtained from full-scale ship trials. It seems that simulation can now identify acceptable ship maneuvering performance in calm seas. However, the effects of wind and current and escort tug assistance have not been that well studied and reported, and they are always important factors for ship maneuvering especially in restricted waters. The numerical simulation program presented in this paper (UBCManeuver) has been validated using data on the Esso Osaka 278,000 DWT tanker, a ship well tested for regular maneuvering tests. UBCManeuver is able to identify IMO class and non-IMO class ships according to the most recent IMO standards for ship maneuverability. A good agreement was obtained between simulation and the sea trials reported for Esso Osaka. After the validation of the code, the course-keeping abilities of this ship in restricted waters were studied in calm seas and under wind and current conditions. The effect of escort tugs on such an operation has also been quantified and Esso Osaka's maneuvering performance around Vancouver harbor simulated. The limits of current and wind strengths for "successful" operation with and without escort tugs have then been established. In addition, the effectiveness of multiple tug assistance in different positions is discussed in some detail.},

The sweeping sphere is constructed by rolling a sphere with its center point along a curve. The initial radius of the sweeping sphere can be set as the minimum distance between an end point and the other curve. The nearest point on a curve must be contained in the sweeping sphere along the other curve, and all of the parts outside the sweeping sphere can be eliminated. A simple sufficient condition when the nearest point is one of the two end points of a curve is provided, which turns the curve/curve case into a point/curve case and leads to higher efficiency. Examples are shown to illustrate efficiency and robustness of the new method. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Misunderstanding each other's intentions is one of the most common causes of shipping accidents. By sending out a number of waypoints ahead and displaying them on the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) a ship's intentions would be clearly visible for other ships. Displaying ships' intentions would be a major change compared to navigation today. It could be very beneficial but it could also have unintended consequences. This paper reports on findings from an evaluation looking for unintended consequences of change using system simulation. During the simulation an unanticipated behavior was observed. Bridge crews started to click and drag waypoints too negotiate crossing situations ahead of time. The behavior could be compared to agreeing over the VHF. However further research is needed to evaluate this new behavior and how it aligns to COLREGS. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent increases in the number of high-speed, large-scale, and heavy-load vessels have made marine traffic more complex. Traffic situations are more difficult to manage as a result because of the rapid increase in the traffic density and the development of ship encounter situations. Here, we introduce a marine traffic complexity model to evaluate the status of traffic situation, use the complexity to investigate the degree of crowding and risk of collision, and support mariners and traffic controllers to get the traffic situation awareness. The traffic unit complexity model is constructed using pair-wise ship traffic characteristics such as the relative distance, relative speed, and intersecting trajectory. This model is extended to an area traffic complexity model through interpolation post-processing. We show that a higher complexity corresponds to more crowding and dangerous traffic in which the traffic situation should be carefully managed. Simulated data from the Shenzhen West Sea are employed to demonstrate the model and construct a map of the spatial distribution of the marine traffic complexity. The complexity model is shown to be effective in indicating different traffic situations.},

abstract = {The paper presents a method of displaying ship collision avoidance information which is based on an unconventional Collision Threat Parameters Area (CTPA) technique. The solution presented here extends CTPA's functionality from past works by supporting navigation in restricted waters and handling ship domains analytically instead of numerically. It visualizes potential navigational threats as well as possible collision avoidance manoeuvres. The proposed method provides three types of information: targets' motion parameters (typical for target tracking), combinations of own course and speed which collide with those targets (typical for CTPA displays) and combinations of own course and speed which collide with stationary obstacles (new elements). Optionally it is also possible to display only manoeuvres compliant with International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) for the present visibility conditions. A superposition of all these types of data enables a navigator to quickly choose an efficient collision avoidance manoeuvre. The paper includes a description of the proposed visualization technique as well as examples of visualised data for encounter situations, which demonstrate the proposed method's usefulness.},

abstract = {This study examined accident reports (n= 23) for collisions between attendant vessels and offshore facilities on the Norwegian continental shelf during the period of 2001-2011. An initial analysis indicated that the concept of situation awareness (SA) might be useful for providing a more detailed understanding of the processes that lead to collisions. SA is defined as 'being aware of what is happening around you and understanding what that information means to you now and in the future' (Endsley, 2012, p. 13). The first part of the study contains an analysis of accident reports that reveals that the collisions with offshore facilities were preceded by loss of SA on the bridge in 18 of the 23 instances. Three types of SA errors were identified: failure to perceive the situation correctly (Level 1 SA; n= 13), failure to comprehend the situation (Level 2 SA; n= 4), and failure to project the situation into the future (Level 3 SA; n= 1). In the second part of the study, the human, technological and organisational factors described in the accident reports are analysed to evaluate how the factors may have affected the duty officers' awareness of the situation. The results indicate that inadequate operation planning, inadequate bridge design, insufficient training, communication failures and distracting elements were the underlying factors that significantly contributed to the collisions.},

To keep pace with current developments, automation seems to be one viable option when it comes to keeping ships running with fewer seafarers available. The aim of this paper is to monitor a modern day mariners' performance while working in a tense situation. The objective is to define the size of the safety domain whilst overtaking a vessel. The approach was to assess the ship's domain area within a 3nm wide traffic separation scheme by using a ship handling simulator. From the simulation results, an overtaking domain was determined as 1.36nm long and 0.4nm wide. Safety domains in real-life situations were experienced on a much smaller scale compared to the previous findings. The working load for this particular operation is expected to be stressful and highly skilled orientated.},

The airline industry felt compelled, as lives, and profits, were at stake [2]. With medical errors believed to cause almost 100,000 deaths annually in the USA, and representing the eight leading cause of preventable death [13, 14], we ought to be similarly motivated. This chapter hopes to offer practical strategies so that our (verbal dexterity' can match our procedural dexterity. This will be done primarily by translating lessons from the flight deck to the bedside. After all, if other high-risk industries such as aviation can do so, then at least as much should be expected of acute care medicine. “Meant is not said, Said is not heard, Heard is not understood, Understood is not done” [1]},

To be able to design motion control systems it is evident that a good mathematical model of the craft and the environment (wind, waves, and ocean currents) are required for simulation and verification of the design. The mathematical models are derived in a vectorial setting using Lagrangian and Newtonian mechanics. Simulation models based on the two main theories - maneuvering and seakeeping - are presented, and the concept of fluid-memory effects are demystified. This text covers state-of-the-art methods for GNC, including nonlinear multivariable PID controllers, state estimators and control allocation methods. More advanced topics, such as optimal control theory, backstepping, feedback linearization and sliding-mode control, are included for the advanced reader.

abstract = {This paper follows the preceding paper of the authors in 1956. Now it may be concluded that ; (1) Steering quality of a ship may be described by a transfer function of the form K (1+T3p) / (1+T1p) (1+T2p) or a set of the steering quality indices K, T1, T2 and T3. These indices are functions of hull form, rudder size and other particulars of a ship. Analytically, they are composed of coefficients of governing equations of motion. (2) In a more practical sense, steering motions of ships are described substantially by a first-order equation of motion T d$\theta$/dt+$\theta$=K$\delta$. Accordingly steering quality may be described in brief by two fundamental indices K and T. (3) Use of the transient response test and frequency response test of a free self-propelled model is an effective means of providing a full description of steering quality in terms of K, T1, T2 and T3, through a procedure not so lengthy as the usual approach of resistance derivatives. (4) Kempf's zig-zag test followed by an analysis employing the first-order equation of motion provides a figure of merit for steering qualities of actual ships in terms of K and T. The zig-zag test would bring out many things about steering quality if it were carried out for many ships. (5) Refering the values of K and T for a number of actual ships, it may be said that (a) improvement of turning ability (increase of K) brings necessarily some reduction of quick-responsibility and stability in steering (increase of T), if the relative rudder size remains constant, (b) rudder size, cut-up of dead-wood and other similar arrangement have fair effects for steering quality, while main hull form has much smaller effects for it. (6) It may be expected that the present expression of steering quality would provide a reasonable basis for design work relating to steering and turning. In this connection, consideration of a feed-back system composed of a ship, a steering gear and a helmsman or anautopilot may be an important aid.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel model and associated data collection method to examine how a distributed organisation of military staff who feed a Common Operating Picture (COP) generates Situation Awareness (SA), a critical component in organisational performance. The proposed empirically derived Situation Awareness Weighted Network (SAWN) model draws on two scientific models of SA, by Endsley involving perception, comprehension and projection, and by Stanton et al. positing that SA exists across a social and semantic network of people and information objects in activities connected across a set of tasks. The output of SAWN is a representation as a weighted semi-bipartite network of the interaction between people (‘human nodes') and information artefacts such as documents and system displays (‘product nodes'); link weights represent the Endsley levels of SA that individuals acquire from or provide to information objects and other individuals. The SAWN method is illustrated with aggregated empirical data from a case study of Australian military staff undertaking their work during two very different scenarios, during steady-state operations and in a crisis threat context. A key outcome of analysis of the weighted networks is that we are able to quantify flow of SA through an organisation as staff seek to “value-add” in the conduct of their work.},

abstract = {The research is performed for Damen Shipyards, a Dutch shipbuilding company, and is about the main control position of a vessel: the bridge. Due to technology evolve- ment and regulatory demands the ship bridge has become a cluttered work environ- ment. To reduce the risk of human errors in operations, their work environment needs to be improved. The overall objective is to develop an identifiable, integrated, and user focused ship bridge concept which should lead to more efficient and safer operations. First the bridge environment, functions, operational demands, human factors, and technologies are analyzed. User observations during operations reveal several usabi- lity issues on the bridge, in the field of ergonomics, human-machine interaction, and appearance. Their origin can be traced back to three main root causes: (1) a lack of knowledge within Damen about human factors and operational demands, (2) business processes, like less knowledge sharing between different departments, and (3) a low level of user involvement during the design process. Considering the trend that the maritime industry will move towards smart vessels with more automated functions, attention has to be paid to user interface design and cog- nitive ergonomics. This leads to the overall research aim to: ‘Compose an integrated design philosophy to decrease the system complexity and increase the interfacing performance'. To be able to improve the current bridge and its environment as an integrated whole, the underlying development process is streamlined as outlined by a design strategy. This strategy also pays attention to the root causes of the usability issues, and ways to tackle them. A strategy roadmap is provided to support the implementation of the strategy and its key values. By performing a case study with an Azimuth Stern Drive tug, insight is created in the application of the strategy, its processes, and the related design philosophy. Hereby a wheelhouse alarm, monitoring, and control system con- cept is developed that has to support the operator to look outside and to maintain its situational awareness. The system concept is tested with users whereafter a design iteration is performed. To come to a complete and integrated wheelhouse concept also other aspects that influence the user experience and vessel operation have to be taken into account. So the concept need to be developed further and tests have to be performed in the field. However the strategy and concept already serve as an important step in enlarging the operational performance and safety. 5},

abstract = {Introduction: There are numerous diverse papers that have addressed issues within maritime safety; to date there has been no comprehensive review of this literature to aggregate the causal factors within accidents in shipping and surmise current knowledge. Methods: This paper reviewed the literature on safety in three key areas: common themes of accidents, the influence of human error, and interventions to make shipping safer. The review included 20 studies of seafaring across the following areas: fatigue, stress, health, situation awareness, teamwork, decision-making, communication, automation, and safety culture. Results: The review identifies the relative contributions of individual and organizational factors in shipping accidents, and also presents the methodological issues with previous research. Conclusions: The paper concludes that monitoring and modifying the human factors issues presented in this paper could contribute to maritime safety performance. Impact on industry: This review illustrates which human factors issues are prevalent in incidents therefore this gives shipping practitioners a focus for interventions. {\textcopyright} 2006 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To ensure the safety of operations in safety-critical systems, it is necessary to maintain operators' situation awareness (SA) at a high level. A situation awareness support system (SASS) has therefore been developed to handle uncertain situations [1]. This paper aims to systematically evaluate the enhancement of SA in SASS by applying a multi-perspective approach. The approach consists of two SA metrics, SAGAT and SART, and one workload metric, NASA-TLX. The first two metrics are used for the direct objective and subjective measurement of SA, while the third is used to estimate operator workload. The approach is applied in a safety-critical environment called residue treater, located at a chemical plant in which a poor human-system interface reduced the operators' SA and caused one of the worst accidents in US history. A counterbalanced within-subjects experiment is performed using a virtual environment interface with and without the support of SASS. The results indicate that SASS improves operators' SA, and specifically has benefits for SA levels 2 and 3. In addition, it is concluded that SASS reduces operator workload, although further investigations in different environments with a larger number of participants have been suggested.},

abstract = {Effective team communication, a fundamental part of team coordination, is crucial for both effective Team Situation Awareness (TSA) and team performance. In this study, we looked at the role that team interaction (i.e., more specifically team verbal behaviors) played in TSA and team performance in order to better understand Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT). We first analyzed team verbal behaviors (i.e., pushing and pulling information) across conditions of human-autonomy teams and human-human teams, and then analyzed their relationship with TSA and team performance via Growth Curve Modelling (GCM). Good teamwork involves anticipating the needs of teammates and that means pushing information before it is requested. Therefore, if things are going well, there should be little need for pulling information. In this study's task, participants were instructed to push information to others, and over time master the specific timing of information sharing to the intended recipient. Findings indicate that pushing information was positively associated with TSA and team performance, and human-autonomy teams had lower levels of both pushing and pulling information than all-human teams. Through this study, we have learned that anticipation of other team member behaviors and information requirements in human-autonomy teams are important for effective TSA and team performance. In order to make HAT more effective in terms of teamwork, we need to develop mechanisms to enhance pushing information within HAT.},

The ship will be continuously monitored by a remote shore centre able to take remote control should the automatic systems falter. For the humans in the shore control centre the usual problems of automations remains as well as a pronounced problem of keeping up adequate situation awareness through remote sensing.

This counterintuitive finding has led to a distinction between the motor difficulty and the cognitive difficulty of a task. The present report summarizes three replications of an experiment in which the two aspects of difficulty were manipulated orthogonally in a recognition task. Participants (total N = 67) responded significantly more accurately and rapidly under conditions in which a cursor had to be moved very precisely (versus imprecisely) into a circle fixed in the center of a computer screen. However, accuracy and response time were compromised with increases in the cognitive difficulty variable (stimulus exposure duration). Visual gaze and pupil dilation data supported the interpretation that attention is elicited by increases in motor difficulty and that performance can benefit from this allocation of attention or mental effort. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

In such circumstances, there is a risk that people are overwhelmed by information during intense periods or, on the other hand, do not build sufficient situational awareness during periods of slack to deal with situations where human intervention becomes necessary. A number of studies show encouraging results in increasing the efficiency of human-machine systems by making the automation adapt itself to the human needs. Current literature shows no examples of adaptive automation in real operational settings, however. We introduce a fine-grained adaptation methodology based on well-established concepts that is easy to comprehend and likely to be accepted by the end user. At the same time, we let the machine operate like a virtual team member in that it continuously builds its own view of the situation independent from the human. Working agreements between human and machine provide lower and upper bounds of automation that are in advance determined by the end user so that unwanted appropriation of responsibility by the machine is avoided. The framework is domain neutral and therefore thought to be applicable across a wide range of complex systems, both military and civilian. It gives researchers an architecture that they can use in their own work to get adaptive automation up and running quickly and easily.},

Maneuvering requirements are a standard part of the contract between shipyard and shipowner. International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations specify minimum requirements for all ships, but shipowners may introduce additional or more severe requirements for certain ship types, like tugs, ferries, dredgers, and exploration ships. The main characteristics of ship maneuverability include initial turning ability, sustained turning ability, yaw checking ability, stopping ability, and yaw stability. The chapter covers maneuvering simulation with known coefficients, giving the mathematical description of maneuvering, simple indicators like the yaw stability index, and the range of methods to determine the maneuvering coefficients. These include model tests, numerical simulations, and system identification in full scale. Heel and shallow water are also discussed as special cases requiring modified approaches in some cases. Side thrusters and rudders are covered in enough detail to allow simple layout and estimate their effect on maneuvers. Finally, the chapter concludes with a description of rudders, covering geometry and arrangement, fundamental hydrodynamic aspects, and design procedures.},

abstract = {In this article, efficient computational models for ship motions are presented. These models are used to simulate ship movements in real time. Compared with traditional approaches, our method possesses the ability to cope with different ship shapes, engines, and sea conditions without the loss of efficiency. Based on our models, we create a ship motion simulation system for both entertainment and educational applications. Our system assists users to learn the motions of a ship encountering waves, currents, and winds. Users can adjust engine powers, rudders, and other ship facilities via a graphical user interface to create their own ship models. They can also change the environment by altering wave frequencies, wave amplitudes, wave directions, currents, and winds. Therefore, numerous combinations of ships and the environment are generated and the learning becomes more amusing. In our system, a ship is treated as a rigid body floating on the sea surface. Its motions compose of 6 degrees of freedom: pitch, heave, roll, surge, sway, and yaw. These motions are divided into two categories. The first three movements are induced by sea waves, and the last three ones are caused by propellers, rudders, currents, and winds. Based on Newton's laws and other basic physics motion models, we deduce algorithms to compute the magnitudes of the motions. Our methods can be carried out in real time and possess high fidelity. According to ship theory, the net effects of external forces on the ship hull depend on the ship shape. Therefore, the behaviors of the ship are influenced by its shape. To enhance our physics models, we classify ships into three basic types. They are flat ships, thin ships, and slender ships. Each type of ship is associated with some predefined parameters to specify their characteristics. Users can tune ship behaviors by varying the parameters even though they have only a little knowledge of ship theory. Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

In our prospective study, one hundred patients on the five months waiting list were allocated randomly to attending the hospital either four months or six months later, the latter serving as a control group for those undergoing treatment. Health status was assessed using a multidimensional questionnaire, which had proven a reliable, valid and sensitive instrument in former studies. After four to six weeks of multidisciplinary inpatient treatment, a significant decrease in pain, anxiety and depression was found, whereas no improvement was observed in the control group. Multidisciplinary inpatient treatment therefore at least has short-term positive effects on patients' health status},

Application of this method provided a coherent and concise compilation of design knowledge for an Adaptive Automation (AA) module for track identification: a theoretical and empirical founded Requirements Baseline with its design rationale consisting of core functions, claims, scenarios and use cases. The core functions focused on coping with workload dynamics and maintaining situation awareness; for each core function we specified claims on the operational effects and requirements for the system, which were added to the use cases specifications.

@article{Chauvin2013,
abstract = {Over the last decade, the shipping industry has implemented a number of measures aimed at improving its safety level (such as new regulations or new forms of team training). Despite this evolution, shipping accidents, and particularly collisions, remain a major concern. This paper presents a modified version of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System, which has been adapted to the maritime context and used to analyse human and organisational factors in collisions reported by the Marine Accident and Investigation Branch (UK) and the Transportation Safety Board (Canada). The analysis shows that most collisions are due to decision errors. At the precondition level, it highlights the importance of the following factors: poor visibility and misuse of instruments (environmental factors), loss of situation awareness or deficit of attention (conditions of operators), deficits in inter-ship communications or Bridge Resource Management (personnel factors). At the leadership level, the analysis reveals the frequent planning of inappropriate operations and non-compliance with the Safety Management System (SMS). The Multiple Accident Analysis provides an important finding concerning three classes of accidents. Inter-ship communications problems and Bridge Resource Management deficiencies are closely linked to collisions occurring in restricted waters and involving pilot-carrying vessels. Another class of collisions is associated with situations of poor visibility, in open sea, and shows deficiencies at every level of the socio-technical system (technical environment, condition of operators, leadership level, and organisational level). The third class is characterised by non-compliance with the SMS. This study shows the importance of Bridge Resource Management for situations of navigation with a pilot on board in restricted waters. It also points out the necessity to investigate, for situations of navigation in open sea, the masters' decisions in critical conditions as well as the causes of non-compliance with SMS. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The probability of grounding a ship manoeuvring in a waterway bend is determined by means of simulation method.

The SURSIM mathematical model is able to predict the necessary manoeuvres and can therefore be used to deter- mine the acceptance of ships on fairways. However, the SURSIM program is mostly developed for use with sea-going ships, and therefore effort is put in investigating how the SURSIM model should be adjusted to be useful for inland ship manoeuvring simulations. This report particularly focuses on the shallow water corrections for resistance, propulsion and manoeuvring forces. It is chosen to carry out a literature study into inland ship resistance and propulsion, while for manoeuvring potential flow calculations using DelKelv are carried out. The performance of DelKelv calculations in the field of ship manoeuvring is tested using a validation study, and afterwards shallow water corrections for an inland ship are computed using potential flow theory. Chapters 5 to 7 discuss the literature study into inland ship resistance, propulsion and manoeuvring. Chapter 8 discusses the validity of potential flow calculations, while chapter 9 gives a review on the performance of the SURSIM model for inland shipping. Conclusions emerging from the study are given in chapter 10. I would like to thank Frans Quadvlieg and Serge Toxopeus from MARIN for providing me with great assistance on the project.

abstract = {Abstract Using a microworld simulation of maritime decision making, we compared two decision support systems (DSS) in their impact upon recovery from interruption. The Temporal Overview Display (TOD) and Change History Table (CHT) - designed to support temporal awareness and change detection, respectively - have previously proven useful in improving situation awareness; however, evaluation of support tools for multitasking environments should not be limited to the specific aspects of the task that they were designed to augment. Using a combination of performance, self-report, and eye-tracking measures, we find that both DSS counter-intuitively have a negative effect on performance. Resumption lags are increased, elevated post-interruption decision-making times persist for longer, and defensive effectiveness is impaired relative to No-DSS. Eye-tracking measures indicate that in the baseline condition, participants tend to encode the visual display more broadly, where as those in the two DSS conditions may have experienced a degree of attentional tunnelling due to high workload. We suggest that for a support tool to be beneficial it should ease the burden on attentional resources so that these can be used for reconstructing a mental model of the post-interruption scene.},

abstract = {A concept of operation for an autonomously navigating unmanned vessel is assumed which still involves a human operator at the decision making level for functions aimed at maintaining safe separation with other traffic. To minimize the occurrence of situations in which collision avoidance manoeuvres must be performed, the operator must be timely aware of potentially conflicting traffic situations. Conflict detection is typically performed by testing whether the current course and speed will result in a future situation in which ownship is no longer ‘well clear'. Resolution is achieved by determining and executing a manoeuvre that will keep ownship well clear. To support the operator with automated conflict detection and resolution functions, ‘well clear' has to be objectively defined and quantified. Options to be considered are the contours of the ship domain or a spatial/temporal separation criterion. This paper discusses how ‘well clear' is related to the ship domain, identifies limitations of a spatial-only definition for well clear and illustrates how the addition of a temporal separation threshold compensates for these limitations.},

The typical reaction to an accident has been a combination of (mainly technical) regulations, changing of procedures and training. Systemic evaluations and changes have rarely been done. Statements made by IMO in recent years claim a shift towards a proactive approach in maritime safety. Key documents, like the IMO Human Element vision, would confirm such statements. This article reviews documents sub- mitted to IMO's Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) in order to evaluate the ‘mechan- isms' of decision-making and the priorities for setting the agenda in MSC regarding maritime human factors. The review confirms that the IMO work related to HF was reactive in the 1990s. There are a number of examples of more recent regulations that can be considered proactive. However, it is too early to fully confirm a proactive policy in the IMO rule-making process.},

abstract = {F.H.H.A. Quadvlieg (MARIN, The Netherlands) P. van Coevorden (Royal Netherlands Navy) In 1993, IMO resolution A751(18) was accepted. Since 1993, ship designs focussed on complying with these standards. For the Netherlands, MARIN gathered the full-scale results of about 100 ships. Performance with respect to IMO A751 requirements was demonstrated in the 2002 meeting of the IMO-DE. It was shown that most ships fulfilled the IMO recommendations. The ships not fulfilling the requirements sailed anyway, manually, or by using an advanced autopilot. Based on the gathered manoeuvring properties of the vessels, the following observations are made. The current standards are focussing much on conventional vessels: displacement ships propelled by standard propulsions (propeller(s) and rudder(s)). For vessels with other propulsion means, the rules are flexible. Also sailing in shallow and restricted water (most critical manoeuvring situations) are not dealt with. The impact of environment (wind, waves and other vessels) is also not taken into account. Because there are no criteria for that, under the economic pressure ships will be constructed " just " fulfilling the design criteria (so-called fit-for-purpose). However, other aspects are also important. On these subjects a set of criteria is proposed and ways to test or verify the designs are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent research has examined the effect that undertaking a cognitively fatiguing task for ≤90 min has on subsequent physical performance. Cognitive fatigue is claimed to affect subsequent physical performance by inducing energy depletion in the brain, depletion of brain catecholamine neurotransmitters or changes in motivation. Observation of the psychophysiology and neurochemistry literature questions the ability of 90 min' cognitive activity to deplete energy or catecholamine resources. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the evidence for cognitive fatigue having an effect on subsequent physical performance. A systematic, meta-analytic review was undertaken. We found a small but significant pooled effect size based on comparison between physical performance post-cognitive fatigue compared to post-control (g = −0.27, SE = −0.12, 95{\%} CI −0.49 to −0.04, Z(10) = −2.283, p {\textless} 0.05). However, the results were not heterogenous (Q(10) = 2.789, p {\textgreater} 0.10, Τ2{\textless} 0.001), suggesting that the pooled effect size does not amount to a real effect and differences are due to random error. No publication bias was evident (Kendall's $\tau$ = −0.07, p {\textgreater} 0.05). Thus, the results are somewhat contradictory. The pooled effect size shows a small but significant negative effect of cognitive fatigue, however tests of heterogeneity show that the results are due to random error. Future research should use neuroscientific tests to ensure that cognitive fatigue has been achieved.},

abstract = {Our knowledge of the function of the auditory nervous system is based upon a wealth of data obtained, for the most part, in anaesthetised animals. More recently, it has been generally acknowledged that factors such as attention profoundly modulate the activity of sensory systems and this can take place at many levels of processing. Imaging studies, in particular, have revealed the greater activation of auditory areas and areas outside of sensory processing areas when attending to a stimulus. We present here a brief review of the consequences of such non-passive listening and go on to describe some of the experiments we are conducting to investigate them. In imaging studies, using fMRI, we can demonstrate the activation of attention networks that are non-specific to the sensory modality as well as greater and different activation of the areas of the supra-temporal plane that includes primary and secondary auditory areas. The profuse descending connections of the auditory system seem likely to be part of the mechanisms subserving attention to sound. These are generally thought to be largely inactivated by anaesthesia. However, we have been able to demonstrate that even in an anaesthetised preparation, removing the descending control from the cortex leads to quite profound changes in the temporal patterns of activation by sounds in thalamus and inferior colliculus. Some of these effects seem to be specific to the ear of stimulation and affect interaural processing. To bridge these observations we are developing an awake behaving preparation involving freely moving animals in which it will be possible to investigate the effects of consciousness (by contrasting awake and anaesthetized), passive and active listening. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Said environment is characterized by continuous communication between vessels and traffic control stations, which poses various challenges for autonomous navigation. We tackle these challenges in four control levels that permit the navigation of an autonomous vessel in today's port environment, based on whether the ship is underway and the need for VHF-communication. The paper concludes with the development and evaluation of operational concepts to make autonomous navigation within the control levels possible. However, (partly) human control is still assumed to be necessary in critical situations.},

abstract = {How does driving experience help in the development of situation awareness? A comparison of detection rates of roadway hazards that involved other road users by inexperienced and experienced car drivers and experienced motorcycle riders with car driving experience was conducted under laboratory conditions. Motorcycle rider-drivers, due to their greater breadth of road experiences, were predicted to have an advantage over other road users in the detection of hazards. Two types of hazards abrupt-onset events and gradual-onset hazards were examined. Abrupt-onset events capture attention by virtue of sudden movement and risk of impending collision, as when a pedestrian runs into the roadway for example. It was expected that these hazards would be detected regardless of experience or situation awareness. Gradual-onset hazards require the anticipation of unfolding events as recognition of the danger from children playing on the footpath, and as such are a test of advanced situation awareness. The results showed no inexperienced-experienced driver differences in the detection of either type of hazard, eliminating hazard-type as an explanation of previous inconsistencies. However, motorcycle rider-drivers detected gradual-onset hazards faster than car drivers and they also perceived more hazards in relatively safe sections of roadway, that is, they showed a higher level of situation awareness. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The pseudoinverse, Linear Programming (LP), Quadratic Programming (QP), Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) are evaluated in simulation on the V-Fides vehicle model. The MILP and MIQP techniques allow to include in their implementations a more detailed characterization of the non-linear static behaviour of the actuators. This customizability can be also exploited to improve the practical stability of the system. The metrics used for comparison include the maximum attainable forces and torques, the integral of the error allocation and the required thrusters effort. Our simulation results show that, in particular with respect to thrusters effort, MILP and MIQP are the preferred allocation methods. The computational complexity associated to both methods is not such to compromise their implementation in operating vehicles; in particular, the MILP version is currently implemented in the V-Fides vehicle.},

abstract = {Experiencing stress during training is a way to prepare professionals for real-life crises. With the help of feedback tools, professionals can train to recognize and overcome negative effects of stress on task performances. This paper reports two studies that empirically examined the effect of such a feedback system. The system, based on the COgnitive Performance and Error (COPE) model, provides its users with physiological, predicted performance and predicted error-chance feedback. The first experiment focussed on creating stressful scenarios and establishing the parameters for the predictive models for the feedback system. Participants (n=9) performed fire-extinguishing tasks on a virtual ship. By altering time pressure, information uncertainty and consequences of performance, stress was induced. COPE variables were measured and models were established that predicted performance and the chances on specific errors. In the second experiment a new group of participants (n=29) carried out the same tasks while receiving eight different combinations of the three feedback types in a counterbalanced order. Performance scores improved when feedback was provided during the task. The number of errors made did not decrease. The usability score for the system with physiological feedback was significantly higher than a system without physiological feedback, unless combined with error feedback.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis paper shows effects of feedback on performances and usability. To improve the effectiveness of the feedback system it is suggested to provide more in-depth tutorial sessions. Design changes are recommended that would make the feedback system more effective in improving performances.},

This study focused on the design of a system to support the user to allocate high-level tasks to unmanned vehicles for military operations and that respects the objectives and restrictions of the user. The domain analysis resulted in an abstraction decomposition space for the domain and nine proposals of patterns for interaction design. This includes a method to align the user and system objectives and to provide additional trans- parency of the system about a proposed schedule's compliance with the user objectives. The effect of the additional transparency was investigated in a user study using a prototype of the system on user performance, situational awareness (SA), trust and cognitive task load. However, there was insuffi- cient statistical power to conclude that the additional transparency, compared to a condition without additional transparency, nor the order of these conditions, had a direct or interaction effect on the par- ticipants, except for a learning effect on SA. Besides other interesting effects, the experiment showed that the order of the conditions with and without additional transparency had an effect on the use of it and a positive attitude of participant towards the system resulted in automation-induced compliance.},

Linear constraints is imposed on input force and moment to be within the physical limits. Collision avoidance is represented as separation of each pair of the elliptic disks, representing the ship domain of our vessel and each encountered one, and is formulated as nonlinear time-varying constraint over the prediction horizon.

abstract = {Abstract Ship manoeuvrability plays a major role in navigation safety. In order to achieve certain manoeuvring requirements, ship configurations need to be specifically considered, which in turn influence the economic performance of shipping. Compared with seagoing ships, inland vessels sail in a more complex navigation environment. At the same time, inland vessels have to operate independently without additional assistance like tugs. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of evaluation and prediction methods for inland vessel manoeuvrability. First of all, different aspects that influence manoeuvrability and the methods assessed for inland vessels and seagoing ships are compared. Accordingly, additional knowledge is required regarding the modelling methods and evaluation criteria of inland vessel manoeuvrability. Furthermore, a step-by-step review on manoeuvrability research relates various impact factors to manoeuvring performance. Finally, the gaps in knowledge of evaluation and prediction methods for inland vessel manoeuvrability in shallow/restricted waterways are described.},

abstract = {In a simulator study parts of the ACCSEAS project's e-Navigation route exchange concept termed “intended routes” has been tested in a full mission bridge simulator using experienced bridge officers in port approach scenarios. By “intended routes” we mean a service where ships underway send a number of waypoints ahead of their present position, from their voyage plan; thus sharing their intentions with ships within radio range. Other ships “intended routes” become visible on the ECDIS screen on request and can be queried for where my own ship is when the other ship is at the cursor indicated point on the displayed “in- tended route”. Observation, focus group interviews and questionnaires were used to capture qualitative data on professional acceptance, the concept, procedural changes, functions and interface. The tested service was very well received with high acceptance ratings.},

@article{Janson2015,
abstract = {This article presents a novel approach, named MCMP (Monte Carlo Motion Planning), to the problem of motion planning under uncertainty, i.e., to the problem of computing a low-cost path that fulfills probabilistic collision avoidance constraints. MCMP estimates the collision probability (CP) of a given path by sampling via Monte Carlo the execution of a reference tracking controller (in this paper we consider LQG). The key algorithmic contribution of this paper is the design of statistical variance-reduction techniques, namely control variates and importance sampling, to make such a sampling procedure amenable to real-time implementation. MCMP applies this CP estimation procedure to motion planning by iteratively (i) computing an (approximately) optimal path for the deterministic version of the problem (here, using the FMT* algorithm), (ii) computing the CP of this path, and (iii) inflating or deflating the obstacles by a common factor depending on whether the CP is higher or lower than a target value. The advantages of MCMP are threefold: (i) asymptotic correctness of CP estimation, as opposed to most current approximations, which, as shown in this paper, can be off by large multiples and hinder the computation of feasible plans; (ii) speed and parallelizability, and (iii) generality, i.e., the approach is applicable to virtually any planning problem provided that a path tracking controller and a notion of distance to obstacles in the configuration space are available. Numerical results illustrate the correctness (in terms of feasibility), efficiency (in terms of path cost), and computational speed of MCMP.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles can obtain navigation information by observing a source with a camera or an acoustic system mounted on the frame of the vehicle. This information properly fused provides navigation information that can overcome the lack of other sources of positioning. However, these systems often have a limited angular field-of-view (FOV). Due to this restriction, motion along some paths will make it impossible to obtain the necessary navigation information as the source is no longer in the vehicle's FOV. This paper proposes both a path planning approach and a guidance control law that allows the vehicle to preserve a certain object or feature inside the FOV while at the same time converging to the proposed path.},

abstract = {People's trust in the health system plays a role in explaining one's access to and utilization of medical care, adherence to medications, continuity of care, and even self-reported health status. Yet it is not easy to find trust measures and understand what they are measuring. A systematic review of scales and indices identified 45 measures of trust within the health system with an average of 12 questions each, which quantified levels of trust among various relationships across the health system. Existing evidence was narrow in scope, where half examined the relationship between doctors/nurses and patients, and the majority were designed, tested and validated in the United States. We developed a health systems trust content area framework, where we identified that honesty, communication, confidence and competence were captured frequently in these measures, with less focus on concepts such as fidelity, system trust, confidentiality and fairness. Half of the measures employed a qualitative method in the design of these measures and 33{\%} were pilot tested. Reporting of test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability were less common. This review identifies a need to develop measurements of trust beyond doctor-patient relationships and outside of U.S. contexts, and strengthen the rigor of existing trust measures. Greater development and use of trust measures in the health system could improve monitoring and evaluation efforts, which may in turn result in better health outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Knowledge intensive processes are often driven and constrained by the mental models of experts acting as direct participants or managers. For example, product development is guided by expert knowledge including critical process relationships which are dynamic, biased by individual perspectives and goals, conditioned by experience, aggregate many system components and relationships and are often nonlinear. Descriptions of these relationships are not generally available from traditional data sources such as company records but are stored in the mental models of the process experts. Often the knowledge is not explicit but is tacit, so it is difficult to describe, examine and use. Consequently, improvement of complex processes is plagued by false starts, failures, institutional and interpersonal conflict, and policy resistance. Formal modeling approaches such as system dynamics are often used to help improve system performance. However, modelers face great difficulties in eliciting and representing the knowledge of the experts in these systems so useful models can be developed. Increased clarity and specificity are required concerning the methods used to elicit expert knowledge for modeling. We propose, describe and illustrate an elicitation method which uses formal modeling and three description format transformations to help experts explicate their tacit knowledge. To illustrate the approach we describe the use of the method to elicit detailed process knowledge describing the development of a new semiconductor chip. The method improved model accuracy and credibility in the eyes of the participants and provided tools for development team mental model improvement. We evaluate our method to identify future research opportunities.},

abstract = {The performance of a ship's rudder largely determines its manoeuvrability, which includes turning ability, initial turning ability, yaw-checking ability and course-keeping ability. However, existing empirical formulas for rudder forces do not concern the rudder profile. This paper discusses the impacts of various rudder profiles on ship manoeuvrability. Instead of empirical formulas for rudder characteristics, Computational Fluid Dynamic methods (CFD) are applied to obtain lift and drag coefficients of five profiles. Then, the normal force coefficient of each profile is calculated and corrected for the aspect ratio. Commercial packages Pointwise and ANSYS ICEM generate the unstructured and structured mesh, respectively. ANSYS Fluent solves the Navier-Stokes equations. 2D steady-state viscous simulations of rudders in incompressible water are carried out with the k-w SST turbulence model. To test the impacts on manoeuvrability, a manoeuvring model is built in Python for the KVLCC2 tanker in deep water. Turning circle manoeuvres and zigzag manoeuvres are performed to compare the manoeuvring parameters. This paper concludes with insights into the impacts of rudder profiles on ship manoeuvrability.},

The analysis of marine casualties raises the question of how casualties occur, and may indicate the circumstances most likely to lead to a casualty. In addition, information may be gained as a basis for estimating the risk of a casualty and for assessing the effectiveness of proposals for improving the safety and efficiency of navigation in the area. The use of casualty statistics as a measure of marine risk has distinct limitations. In most areas a casualty is a reasonably rare occurrence, so that any systematic analysis of casualties will normally have to take place over a period of a few years; and, if improvements are made, a further period of time is necessary to measure their effectiveness.},
