abstract = {The performance of a ship's rudder largely determines its manoeuvrability, which includes turning ability, initial turning ability, yaw-checking ability and course-keeping ability. However, existing empirical formulas for rudder forces do not concern the rudder profile. This paper discusses the impacts of various rudder profiles on ship manoeuvrability. Instead of empirical formulas for rudder characteristics, Computational Fluid Dynamic methods (CFD) are applied to obtain lift and drag coefficients of five profiles. Then, the normal force coefficient of each profile is calculated and corrected for the aspect ratio. Commercial packages Pointwise and ANSYS ICEM generate the unstructured and structured mesh, respectively. ANSYS Fluent solves the Navier-Stokes equations. 2D steady-state viscous simulations of rudders in incompressible water are carried out with the k-w SST turbulence model. To test the impacts on manoeuvrability, a manoeuvring model is built in Python for the KVLCC2 tanker in deep water. Turning circle manoeuvres and zigzag manoeuvres are performed to compare the manoeuvring parameters. This paper concludes with insights into the impacts of rudder profiles on ship manoeuvrability.},

abstract = {The research is performed for Damen Shipyards, a Dutch shipbuilding company, and is about the main control position of a vessel: the bridge. Due to technology evolve- ment and regulatory demands the ship bridge has become a cluttered work environ- ment. To reduce the risk of human errors in operations, their work environment needs to be improved. The overall objective is to develop an identifiable, integrated, and user focused ship bridge concept which should lead to more efficient and safer operations. First the bridge environment, functions, operational demands, human factors, and technologies are analyzed. User observations during operations reveal several usabi- lity issues on the bridge, in the field of ergonomics, human-machine interaction, and appearance. Their origin can be traced back to three main root causes: (1) a lack of knowledge within Damen about human factors and operational demands, (2) business processes, like less knowledge sharing between different departments, and (3) a low level of user involvement during the design process. Considering the trend that the maritime industry will move towards smart vessels with more automated functions, attention has to be paid to user interface design and cog- nitive ergonomics. This leads to the overall research aim to: ‘Compose an integrated design philosophy to decrease the system complexity and increase the interfacing performance'. To be able to improve the current bridge and its environment as an integrated whole, the underlying development process is streamlined as outlined by a design strategy. This strategy also pays attention to the root causes of the usability issues, and ways to tackle them. A strategy roadmap is provided to support the implementation of the strategy and its key values. By performing a case study with an Azimuth Stern Drive tug, insight is created in the application of the strategy, its processes, and the related design philosophy. Hereby a wheelhouse alarm, monitoring, and control system con- cept is developed that has to support the operator to look outside and to maintain its situational awareness. The system concept is tested with users whereafter a design iteration is performed. To come to a complete and integrated wheelhouse concept also other aspects that influence the user experience and vessel operation have to be taken into account. So the concept need to be developed further and tests have to be performed in the field. However the strategy and concept already serve as an important step in enlarging the operational performance and safety. 5},

abstract = {Collision avoidance is an essential safety requirement for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Normally, its practical verification is non-trivial, due to the stochastic behaviours of both the USVs and the intruders. This paper presents the probabilistic timed automata (PTAs) based formalism for three collision avoidance behaviours of USVs in uncertain dynamic environments, which are associated with the crossing situation in COLREGs. Steering right, acceleration, and deceleration are considered potential evasive manoeuvres. The state-of-the-art prism model checker is applied to analyse the underlying models. This work provides a framework and practical application of the probabilistic model checking for decision making in collision avoidance for USVs.},

abstract = {Abstract Using a microworld simulation of maritime decision making, we compared two decision support systems (DSS) in their impact upon recovery from interruption. The Temporal Overview Display (TOD) and Change History Table (CHT) - designed to support temporal awareness and change detection, respectively - have previously proven useful in improving situation awareness; however, evaluation of support tools for multitasking environments should not be limited to the specific aspects of the task that they were designed to augment. Using a combination of performance, self-report, and eye-tracking measures, we find that both DSS counter-intuitively have a negative effect on performance. Resumption lags are increased, elevated post-interruption decision-making times persist for longer, and defensive effectiveness is impaired relative to No-DSS. Eye-tracking measures indicate that in the baseline condition, participants tend to encode the visual display more broadly, where as those in the two DSS conditions may have experienced a degree of attentional tunnelling due to high workload. We suggest that for a support tool to be beneficial it should ease the burden on attentional resources so that these can be used for reconstructing a mental model of the post-interruption scene.},

abstract = {There is a continuing trend of letting fewer people deal with larger amounts of information in more complex situations using highly automated systems. In such circumstances, there is a risk that people are overwhelmed by information during intense periods or, on the other hand, do not build sufficient situational awareness during periods of slack to deal with situations where human intervention becomes necessary. A number of studies show encouraging results in increasing the efficiency of human-machine systems by making the automation adapt itself to the human needs. Current literature shows no examples of adaptive automation in real operational settings, however. We introduce a fine-grained adaptation methodology based on well-established concepts that is easy to comprehend and likely to be accepted by the end user. At the same time, we let the machine operate like a virtual team member in that it continuously builds its own view of the situation independent from the human. Working agreements between human and machine provide lower and upper bounds of automation that are in advance determined by the end user so that unwanted appropriation of responsibility by the machine is avoided. The framework is domain neutral and therefore thought to be applicable across a wide range of complex systems, both military and civilian. It gives researchers an architecture that they can use in their own work to get adaptive automation up and running quickly and easily.},

abstract = {This study examined accident reports (n= 23) for collisions between attendant vessels and offshore facilities on the Norwegian continental shelf during the period of 2001-2011. An initial analysis indicated that the concept of situation awareness (SA) might be useful for providing a more detailed understanding of the processes that lead to collisions. SA is defined as 'being aware of what is happening around you and understanding what that information means to you now and in the future' (Endsley, 2012, p. 13). The first part of the study contains an analysis of accident reports that reveals that the collisions with offshore facilities were preceded by loss of SA on the bridge in 18 of the 23 instances. Three types of SA errors were identified: failure to perceive the situation correctly (Level 1 SA; n= 13), failure to comprehend the situation (Level 2 SA; n= 4), and failure to project the situation into the future (Level 3 SA; n= 1). In the second part of the study, the human, technological and organisational factors described in the accident reports are analysed to evaluate how the factors may have affected the duty officers' awareness of the situation. The results indicate that inadequate operation planning, inadequate bridge design, insufficient training, communication failures and distracting elements were the underlying factors that significantly contributed to the collisions.},

abstract = {Abstract Ship manoeuvrability plays a major role in navigation safety. In order to achieve certain manoeuvring requirements, ship configurations need to be specifically considered, which in turn influence the economic performance of shipping. Compared with seagoing ships, inland vessels sail in a more complex navigation environment. At the same time, inland vessels have to operate independently without additional assistance like tugs. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of evaluation and prediction methods for inland vessel manoeuvrability. First of all, different aspects that influence manoeuvrability and the methods assessed for inland vessels and seagoing ships are compared. Accordingly, additional knowledge is required regarding the modelling methods and evaluation criteria of inland vessel manoeuvrability. Furthermore, a step-by-step review on manoeuvrability research relates various impact factors to manoeuvring performance. Finally, the gaps in knowledge of evaluation and prediction methods for inland vessel manoeuvrability in shallow/restricted waterways are described.},

The typical reaction to an accident has been a combination of (mainly technical) regulations, changing of procedures and training. Systemic evaluations and changes have rarely been done. Statements made by IMO in recent years claim a shift towards a proactive approach in maritime safety. Key documents, like the IMO Human Element vision, would confirm such statements. This article reviews documents sub- mitted to IMO's Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) in order to evaluate the ‘mechan- isms' of decision-making and the priorities for setting the agenda in MSC regarding maritime human factors. The review confirms that the IMO work related to HF was reactive in the 1990s. There are a number of examples of more recent regulations that can be considered proactive. However, it is too early to fully confirm a proactive policy in the IMO rule-making process.},

The proposed empirically derived Situation Awareness Weighted Network (SAWN) model draws on two scientific models of SA, by Endsley involving perception, comprehension and projection, and by Stanton et al. positing that SA exists across a social and semantic network of people and information objects in activities connected across a set of tasks. The output of SAWN is a representation as a weighted semi-bipartite network of the interaction between people (‘human nodes') and information artefacts such as documents and system displays (‘product nodes'); link weights represent the Endsley levels of SA that individuals acquire from or provide to information objects and other individuals. The SAWN method is illustrated with aggregated empirical data from a case study of Australian military staff undertaking their work during two very different scenarios, during steady-state operations and in a crisis threat context. A key outcome of analysis of the weighted networks is that we are able to quantify flow of SA through an organisation as staff seek to “value-add” in the conduct of their work.},

A constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to minimize vessel states??? deviation from a time varying reference generated by a virtual vessel over a finite horizon. Linear constraints is imposed on input force and moment to be within the physical limits. Collision avoidance is represented as separation of each pair of the elliptic disks, representing the ship domain of our vessel and each encountered one, and is formulated as nonlinear time-varying constraint over the prediction horizon. A real-time C-code is generated using the ACADO toolkit and qpOASES solver with multiple shooting technique for discretization and Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm. This algorithm is computationally efficient, thus enabling real-time implementation of the proposed technique. MATLAB simulations are used to assess the validity of the proposed technique.},

Then, a sample of 141 Officers were asked to give their opinion about the importance of each adjective in Seafarer's behaviour. Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis through Structural Equation Modelling techniques were applied to the data. Two factors were identified in aptitudes: ???Situation awareness??? comprising adjectives from levels 1-2-3 SA; and ???adaptability???. From attitudes, first component is ???Self-Knowledge???, component 2 ???Group Skills??? and component 3 ???Drive???. Structural Equation Modelling confirmed the factor structure previously found. It can be concluded that: SA would be a key factor in Sea Navigation, there is psychometric evidence of the construct validity; and Human Factors in seafaring can be described using a five-factor model.},

abstract = {Introduction: There are numerous diverse papers that have addressed issues within maritime safety; to date there has been no comprehensive review of this literature to aggregate the causal factors within accidents in shipping and surmise current knowledge. Methods: This paper reviewed the literature on safety in three key areas: common themes of accidents, the influence of human error, and interventions to make shipping safer. The review included 20 studies of seafaring across the following areas: fatigue, stress, health, situation awareness, teamwork, decision-making, communication, automation, and safety culture. Results: The review identifies the relative contributions of individual and organizational factors in shipping accidents, and also presents the methodological issues with previous research. Conclusions: The paper concludes that monitoring and modifying the human factors issues presented in this paper could contribute to maritime safety performance. Impact on industry: This review illustrates which human factors issues are prevalent in incidents therefore this gives shipping practitioners a focus for interventions. {\textcopyright} 2006 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Chauvin2013,
abstract = {Over the last decade, the shipping industry has implemented a number of measures aimed at improving its safety level (such as new regulations or new forms of team training). Despite this evolution, shipping accidents, and particularly collisions, remain a major concern. This paper presents a modified version of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System, which has been adapted to the maritime context and used to analyse human and organisational factors in collisions reported by the Marine Accident and Investigation Branch (UK) and the Transportation Safety Board (Canada). The analysis shows that most collisions are due to decision errors. At the precondition level, it highlights the importance of the following factors: poor visibility and misuse of instruments (environmental factors), loss of situation awareness or deficit of attention (conditions of operators), deficits in inter-ship communications or Bridge Resource Management (personnel factors). At the leadership level, the analysis reveals the frequent planning of inappropriate operations and non-compliance with the Safety Management System (SMS). The Multiple Accident Analysis provides an important finding concerning three classes of accidents. Inter-ship communications problems and Bridge Resource Management deficiencies are closely linked to collisions occurring in restricted waters and involving pilot-carrying vessels. Another class of collisions is associated with situations of poor visibility, in open sea, and shows deficiencies at every level of the socio-technical system (technical environment, condition of operators, leadership level, and organisational level). The third class is characterised by non-compliance with the SMS. This study shows the importance of Bridge Resource Management for situations of navigation with a pilot on board in restricted waters. It also points out the necessity to investigate, for situations of navigation in open sea, the masters' decisions in critical conditions as well as the causes of non-compliance with SMS. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Knowledge intensive processes are often driven and constrained by the mental models of experts acting as direct participants or managers. For example, product development is guided by expert knowledge including critical process relationships which are dynamic, biased by individual perspectives and goals, conditioned by experience, aggregate many system components and relationships and are often nonlinear. Descriptions of these relationships are not generally available from traditional data sources such as company records but are stored in the mental models of the process experts. Often the knowledge is not explicit but is tacit, so it is difficult to describe, examine and use. Consequently, improvement of complex processes is plagued by false starts, failures, institutional and interpersonal conflict, and policy resistance. Formal modeling approaches such as system dynamics are often used to help improve system performance. However, modelers face great difficulties in eliciting and representing the knowledge of the experts in these systems so useful models can be developed. Increased clarity and specificity are required concerning the methods used to elicit expert knowledge for modeling. We propose, describe and illustrate an elicitation method which uses formal modeling and three description format transformations to help experts explicate their tacit knowledge. To illustrate the approach we describe the use of the method to elicit detailed process knowledge describing the development of a new semiconductor chip. The method improved model accuracy and credibility in the eyes of the participants and provided tools for development team mental model improvement. We evaluate our method to identify future research opportunities.},

Evidence suggests exactly the same for acute care medicine [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. However, in contrast to aviation, medical curricula focus on factual knowledge and procedural dexterity but rarely address ingrained culture or its effect upon communication [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The airline industry felt compelled, as lives, and profits, were at stake [2]. With medical errors believed to cause almost 100,000 deaths annually in the USA, and representing the eight leading cause of preventable death [13, 14], we ought to be similarly motivated. This chapter hopes to offer practical strategies so that our (verbal dexterity' can match our procedural dexterity. This will be done primarily by translating lessons from the flight deck to the bedside. After all, if other high-risk industries such as aviation can do so, then at least as much should be expected of acute care medicine. “Meant is not said, Said is not heard, Heard is not understood, Understood is not done” [1]},

The system, based on the COgnitive Performance and Error (COPE) model, provides its users with physiological, predicted performance and predicted error-chance feedback. The first experiment focussed on creating stressful scenarios and establishing the parameters for the predictive models for the feedback system. Participants (n=9) performed fire-extinguishing tasks on a virtual ship. By altering time pressure, information uncertainty and consequences of performance, stress was induced. COPE variables were measured and models were established that predicted performance and the chances on specific errors. In the second experiment a new group of participants (n=29) carried out the same tasks while receiving eight different combinations of the three feedback types in a counterbalanced order. Performance scores improved when feedback was provided during the task. The number of errors made did not decrease. The usability score for the system with physiological feedback was significantly higher than a system without physiological feedback, unless combined with error feedback.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis paper shows effects of feedback on performances and usability.

The MILP and MIQP techniques allow to include in their implementations a more detailed characterization of the non-linear static behaviour of the actuators. This customizability can be also exploited to improve the practical stability of the system. The metrics used for comparison include the maximum attainable forces and torques, the integral of the error allocation and the required thrusters effort. Our simulation results show that, in particular with respect to thrusters effort, MILP and MIQP are the preferred allocation methods.

abstract = {In English. "This book includes methods for the design and implementation of industrial guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems for ships, high-speed craft, semi-submersibles, submarines, underwater vehicles and ocean structures. To be able to design motion control systems it is evident that a good mathematical model of the craft and the environment (wind, waves, and ocean currents) are required for simulation and verification of the design. The mathematical models are derived in a vectorial setting using Lagrangian and Newtonian mechanics. Simulation models based on the two main theories - maneuvering and seakeeping - are presented, and the concept of fluid-memory effects are demystified. This text covers state-of-the-art methods for GNC, including nonlinear multivariable PID controllers, state estimators and control allocation methods. More advanced topics, such as optimal control theory, backstepping, feedback linearization and sliding-mode control, are included for the advanced reader. Case studies and applications are treated at the end of each chapter. The Marine Systems Simulator (MSS), which is an open source Matlab toolbox, is used for illustration"-- "The book is divided into three parts; the first describes modelling of marine craft"-- I.

abstract = {How does driving experience help in the development of situation awareness? A comparison of detection rates of roadway hazards that involved other road users by inexperienced and experienced car drivers and experienced motorcycle riders with car driving experience was conducted under laboratory conditions. Motorcycle rider-drivers, due to their greater breadth of road experiences, were predicted to have an advantage over other road users in the detection of hazards. Two types of hazards abrupt-onset events and gradual-onset hazards were examined. Abrupt-onset events capture attention by virtue of sudden movement and risk of impending collision, as when a pedestrian runs into the roadway for example. It was expected that these hazards would be detected regardless of experience or situation awareness. Gradual-onset hazards require the anticipation of unfolding events as recognition of the danger from children playing on the footpath, and as such are a test of advanced situation awareness. The results showed no inexperienced-experienced driver differences in the detection of either type of hazard, eliminating hazard-type as an explanation of previous inconsistencies. However, motorcycle rider-drivers detected gradual-onset hazards faster than car drivers and they also perceived more hazards in relatively safe sections of roadway, that is, they showed a higher level of situation awareness. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The role of military operators is changing towards supervision of multiple unmanned vehicles. This places new demands on the operators that require supportive systems. This study focused on the design of a system to support the user to allocate high-level tasks to unmanned vehicles for military operations and that respects the objectives and restrictions of the user. The domain analysis resulted in an abstraction decomposition space for the domain and nine proposals of patterns for interaction design. This includes a method to align the user and system objectives and to provide additional trans- parency of the system about a proposed schedule's compliance with the user objectives. The effect of the additional transparency was investigated in a user study using a prototype of the system on user performance, situational awareness (SA), trust and cognitive task load. However, there was insuffi- cient statistical power to conclude that the additional transparency, compared to a condition without additional transparency, nor the order of these conditions, had a direct or interaction effect on the par- ticipants, except for a learning effect on SA. Besides other interesting effects, the experiment showed that the order of the conditions with and without additional transparency had an effect on the use of it and a positive attitude of participant towards the system resulted in automation-induced compliance.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles can obtain navigation information by observing a source with a camera or an acoustic system mounted on the frame of the vehicle. This information properly fused provides navigation information that can overcome the lack of other sources of positioning. However, these systems often have a limited angular field-of-view (FOV). Due to this restriction, motion along some paths will make it impossible to obtain the necessary navigation information as the source is no longer in the vehicle's FOV. This paper proposes both a path planning approach and a guidance control law that allows the vehicle to preserve a certain object or feature inside the FOV while at the same time converging to the proposed path.},

@article{Li2005,
abstract = {A number of recent large-ship accidents have compelled naval architects and engineers to advance the research on ship maneuverability and the prediction of ship response in the ocean environment. In the meantime, new maneuverability standards have been developed and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has also proposed one such standard. This standard provides four ship-maneuvering performance criteria, and its latest version is dated December 2002. Simulation technology, in particular the simulation of ship maneuvering, has advanced considerably in recent years with the advent of computers. Computer programs using either numerically computed or experimentally determined hydrodynamics coefficients have allowed an accurate simulation of ship maneuverability for different types of vessels. Relatively good agreement has been reported by various researchers between simulated results and those obtained from full-scale ship trials. It seems that simulation can now identify acceptable ship maneuvering performance in calm seas. However, the effects of wind and current and escort tug assistance have not been that well studied and reported, and they are always important factors for ship maneuvering especially in restricted waters. The numerical simulation program presented in this paper (UBCManeuver) has been validated using data on the Esso Osaka 278,000 DWT tanker, a ship well tested for regular maneuvering tests. UBCManeuver is able to identify IMO class and non-IMO class ships according to the most recent IMO standards for ship maneuverability. A good agreement was obtained between simulation and the sea trials reported for Esso Osaka. After the validation of the code, the course-keeping abilities of this ship in restricted waters were studied in calm seas and under wind and current conditions. The effect of escort tugs on such an operation has also been quantified and Esso Osaka's maneuvering performance around Vancouver harbor simulated. The limits of current and wind strengths for "successful" operation with and without escort tugs have then been established. In addition, the effectiveness of multiple tug assistance in different positions is discussed in some detail.},

abstract = {The paper presents a method of displaying ship collision avoidance information which is based on an unconventional Collision Threat Parameters Area (CTPA) technique. The solution presented here extends CTPA's functionality from past works by supporting navigation in restricted waters and handling ship domains analytically instead of numerically. It visualizes potential navigational threats as well as possible collision avoidance manoeuvres. The proposed method provides three types of information: targets' motion parameters (typical for target tracking), combinations of own course and speed which collide with those targets (typical for CTPA displays) and combinations of own course and speed which collide with stationary obstacles (new elements). Optionally it is also possible to display only manoeuvres compliant with International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) for the present visibility conditions. A superposition of all these types of data enables a navigator to quickly choose an efficient collision avoidance manoeuvre. The paper includes a description of the proposed visualization technique as well as examples of visualised data for encounter situations, which demonstrate the proposed method's usefulness.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter highlights the ship maneuvering that comprises course keeping, course changing, track keeping, and speed changing. Maneuvering requirements are a standard part of the contract between shipyard and shipowner. International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations specify minimum requirements for all ships, but shipowners may introduce additional or more severe requirements for certain ship types, like tugs, ferries, dredgers, and exploration ships. The main characteristics of ship maneuverability include initial turning ability, sustained turning ability, yaw checking ability, stopping ability, and yaw stability. The chapter covers maneuvering simulation with known coefficients, giving the mathematical description of maneuvering, simple indicators like the yaw stability index, and the range of methods to determine the maneuvering coefficients. These include model tests, numerical simulations, and system identification in full scale. Heel and shallow water are also discussed as special cases requiring modified approaches in some cases. Side thrusters and rudders are covered in enough detail to allow simple layout and estimate their effect on maneuvers. Finally, the chapter concludes with a description of rudders, covering geometry and arrangement, fundamental hydrodynamic aspects, and design procedures.},
