In the previous part a decision model is described which tries to avoid communication between vessels by taking the right decision at the right moment to ensure an unimpeded voyage. However this is not always possible. This is often the case due to missing information, or a lack of understanding about the intentions of other vessels. With manned ships, verbal communication via \ac{VHF} is used to acquire the missing information or discuss strategies with other ships. Thus to have unmanned vessel sail between manned vessel, a protocol is needed.

A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message. Where it is most straight forward to use verbal communication, will it not be limited to this, as it might result in better situational awareness for both the manned and unmanned to use other means, such as visible signals.

The communication which currently happens between vessels is mostly when \ac{COLREGs} are not followed, or when intentions are not clear. Other communication which will not be within the scope of this research, such as the communication with traffic controllers and how conversations are interpreted by other vessels.
Thus this research is a starting point to develop a full protocol needed for the acceptance of unmanned vessels.

Using the \acf{sCE} method, this protocol can be developed using an iterative process where a  requirement baseline is continuously refined by reviews and prototype evaluations. How to apply \ac{sCE} is described by Neerincx and Linderberg \cite{Neerincx2012}.

The first step is to create a foundation. The current situation of the problem is discussed, which have to be solved. Thereby considering existing knowledge which might be relevant to solve the problem and finally in short the envisioned technology. The next step is to define the system design specification. In which scenarios are described which show how the problem is solved. From this can be extracted what should be designed and why this is done. Using this a design is made which is being evaluated to make improvement in next iterative steps.
