It is not always possible to operate without communication, as is tried to accomplish in part~\ref{part:MT}. This is often the case due to missing information, or a lack of understanding about the intentions of other vessels. With manned ships, verbal communication via \ac{VHF} radio is used to acquire the missing information or discuss strategies with other ships. This communication is likely to be also necessary when unmanned vessel operate between manned vessel. This part discusses the development process of such a protocol. The relevance of such a protocol is proved using an experiment. This part will answer the following question:

	\emph{Will a protocol based on existing maritime systems and communication protocols be sufficient to ensure safe navigation, while manned and unmanned vessels encounter each other?}
\end{quotation}

A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission or receipt of a message. Where it is mostly straightforward to use verbal communication, will it not be limited to this. As it might result in better situational awareness for both the manned and unmanned to use other means, such as visible signals or text messaging.

The communication which currently happens between vessels is most common when \ac{COLREGs} do not result in clear strategies, or when intentions are not clear. Other communication which will not be within the scope of this research, is the communication with traffic controllers and how other vessels interpret conversations.
Thus this research is a starting point to develop a full protocol needed for the acceptance of unmanned vessels.

This protocol is developed using an iterative process based on the \acf{sCE} method. Where reviews and prototype evaluations continuously refine a requirement baseline. How to apply \ac{sCE} is described by Neerincx and Linderberg \cite{Neerincx2012}.

The first step is to create a foundation. The current situation of the problem is addressed. Thereby considering existing knowledge which might be relevant to solve the problem, which results in the envisioned technology. The next step is to define the system design specification. In which scenarios are described which show how the problem is solved. From this can be extracted what should be designed and why this is done. Using this a design is made which is being evaluated to make improvements in next iterative steps.
