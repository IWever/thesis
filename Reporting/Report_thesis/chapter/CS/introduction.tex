In the previous part a decision model is described which uses only criteria which do not require communication for an unimpeded voyage. There are however cases in which the decision model can't determine the right strategy. This is often the case due to missing information, or a lack of understanding about the intentions of other vessels. With manned ships verbal communication is used get the missing information, or discuss a strategy with other ships. To have unmanned vessel sail between manned vessel, an interface is needed.

Using the \acf{sCE} method, this interface can be developed using an iterative process where a  requirement  baseline  is  continuously  refined by  reviews  and  prototype  evaluations. How to apply \ac{sCE} is described by Neerincx and Linderberg \cite{Neerincx2012}.

First step is to create a foundation. This discusses the problem to be solved, existing knowledge to solve the problem and the envisioned technology. This together forms the system design specification. Which describes the solution in the form of a system design. This design is finally evaluated.
