The previous part described the context in which this research will be done. This part will describe the philosophy on the development of the model, which is used to gain insight into operations at sea. These insights are used to come up with strategies to improve the navigational safety.

This is acquired by first setting up a model which shows the different subjects relevant for developing the above mentioned model. Based on this model a basic design is made, where requirements are defined, in such a way that users can get the desired functionality from the application which runs the model.
This part ends with a description of the basic architecture. Which shows the design patterns and important classes and methods. Within this application the different models and scenarios can be implemented. Which will be discussed in the next sections.
