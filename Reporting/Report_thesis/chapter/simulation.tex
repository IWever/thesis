\section{Design of the tool}

\subsection{User stories}
To develop a tool which can be used properly a list of requirements can be made. But more efficient is to make a checklist of user stories. These are in the excel.

\subsection{Model for tool}
Viewer simulation with backend

\subsection{Define classes}

\subsection{Define methods}


\section{Determine closes point of approach}
Method to define if something is a hazard. Incorporate well-clear from previous chapter.
In the maple file

\section{Hazards}
Pin-point hazards, to show why a route is most likely.

\section{Routeplanner}
What is most likely the route. Based on high probability, combined with low probability other vessels.

\section{Estimate characteristics}
