\chapter{Information at the bridge}
The bridge of a vessel can be separated into four elements. The human operator, procedures,
technical system and the human-machine interface. This chapter will focus on the technical system and human-machine interface. Thereby a separation will be made between the instruments available, the information which can be deducted from this and how this can be used.

The shipâ€™s navigation bridge shall enable the officer in charge of the navigational watch to perform navigational duties unassisted at all times during normal operating conditions. He shall be able to maintain a proper lookout by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make full appraisal of the situation and the risk of collision, grounding and other hazards to navigation.
