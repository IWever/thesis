\section{Manoeuvring capability model}
Estimation of relation between throttle, loss of speed while turning. Thus a mapping from current speed, current rotation, rudder angle and throttle to future speed and turning speed

\section{Probability index}
what should the polygons show

\section{Routeplanner}
Including the usage of waypoints with weights

\section{Estimation of characteristics}
Deadweight to displacement for example
