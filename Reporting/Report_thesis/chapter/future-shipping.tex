\chapter{Future of shipping}
\label{sec:future}
The shipping industry is traditionally driven by regulations and making profit within these given boundaries. With small margins, this does lead to a conservative industry. On the other hand do many CEOs state that digitalization and de-carbonization are watchwords for the coming decade. Projects around this should be leading to a safer shipping industry, which becomes more efficient and at the same time reducing its environmental footprint \cite{Eriksen2017}, while maintaining its competitiveness. This research will mainly focus on improving safety at sea, the digitalization is most relevant here, certainly when it comes to autonomous and unmanned ships. A description will be given of the steps which will most likely be taken in the coming years, which projects are working on the steps towards the future.

Focusing on the digitalization, ships will become more sophisticated. More data is generated by sensors, improved connectivity and new ways to visualize data. This enables ships to continuously communicate with managers and traffic controllers. At first, this can be used to analyze data and give better advice based on expected weather, fuel consumption and arrivals at bottlenecks like ports and bridges.
But further ahead this might result in unmanned vessels. Either remotely operated from shore, on autopilot or completely autonomous. The main arguments heard for the transition towards autonomous or unmanned ships:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Improved safety}, as most accidents are caused by human errors.
	\item \emph{Lower cost}, as insurance goes down due to improved safety and manning is a large portion of total cost.
	\item \emph{Higher productivity}, when there is better usage of data and communication. Thereby comes that computers don't have to work in shifts to go home or take breaks.
	\item \emph{Improve competitiveness}, as tankers which are traded for example, do not have to enter a harbor to get fresh supplies.
	\item \emph{More comfort and attractiveness industry}, as people can have more regular hours to work and do not have to be away for many weeks when working remote.
\end{itemize}
The different projects around the world, working on the transition towards autonomous or unmanned vessel, are mentioned with their current status.

\section{Projects}
The research project MUNIN has been one of the major projects by a consortium of shipbuilders and scientists. The name is an abbreviation for Maritime Unmanned Navigation through Intelligence in Networks and originated from WATERBORNE, an initiative from the EU and Maritime Industries Forum, supporting cooperation and exchange of knowledge between stakeholders within the deep and short sea shipping industry. They did an initial research between 2013 and 2016. Focussing on different elements of an autonomous concept: The development of an IT architecture. Analysis tasks performed on today's bridge and how this will be on an autonomous bridge. Examine the tasks in relation to a vesselâ€™s technical system and develop a concept for autonomous operation of the engine room. Define the processes in a shoreside operation center, required to enable a remote control of the vessel. Thereby taking into account the feasibility of the developed solution, including legal and liability barriers for unmanned vessels.
They concluded that unmanned vessels can contribute to the aim of a more sustainable maritime transport industry. Especially in Europe, shipping companies have to deal with a demographic change within a highly competitive industry, while at the same time the rising ecological awareness exerts additional pressure on them. The autonomous ship represents a long-term, but comprehensive solution to meet these challenges, as it bears the potential to: Reduce operational expenses and
environmental impact.
A concept was developed for a bulker vessel, enabling the consortium to do a financial analysis. Showing the viability, but admitting the limited scope of the project \cite{MUNIN2016}.

\subsection{Visionary projects}
Rolls-Royce Marine is involved in different projects which are in some way follow-ups on the MUNIN project. Well-known are the videos of the virtual bridge concept and the Electric Blue vessel, as this was a first clearly drawn vision of how the shipping industry could look like in the future. Electric Blue is a concept ship, based on a standard 1000 \ac{TEU} feeder. The ship is very adaptable, it can sail for example on both diesel and electricity. The modularity enables Electric Blue to adapt for specific routes and meet environmental requirements now, and in the future. 
Keeping in mind the way towards autonomous, will it start with a virtual bridge, housed below the containers. Utilizing the opportunities of sensors for safe navigation, employing radar, camera, IR camera, lidar and \ac{AIS}. The roadmap for this concept is to have partial autonomy by 2020, remote operation between 2025 and 2030, starting with a reduced passive crew on board. And be fully autonomous in 2035 \cite{Wilson2017}. 
To make these steps they were aware from the start on, that the control room is the nerve center of remote operations. Using an interactive environment with a screen for decision support and improving situation awareness with augmented reality. With these developments does their vision look very promising. However there have not yet been successful prototypes.

Other projects which have clearly published there vision for the future are:
- DIMECC with (One Sea)\\
- AAWA\\
- ReVolt\\

Since June 2017 is Rolls-Royce also involved in the unmanned cargo ship development alliance, which is initiated by Asian companies and classification bureaus.
In the Netherlands a \ac{JIP} has started on autonomous shipping.

\subsection{Industry projects}
Beside the visionary projects mentioned before, some companies are also coming with real results. Often funded by customers of shipping companies.
The Yara Birkeland is one of the projects ahead of the pack, already building and testing a 120 \ac{TEU} container ship. This vessel will initially operate as fully electric manned vessel, but plans are that it will sail autonomously in 2020. Operating between different Yara facilities in Norway, transporting fertilizers and raw materials. 
Kongsberg is responsible for the development and delivery of all key enabling technologies. Including the sensors and integration required for remote and autonomous operations, in addition to the electric drive, battery and propulsion control systems \cite{Sames2017}.

Other smaller projects are the development of Norwegian ferries, which are likely to start sailing automated from 2018, just like an automated shuttle service for offshore installations. A partly Dutch project is the Roboat, where a fleet of small pontoons will be used to solve problems on urban waterways. Such as transportation of people and goods or creating temporary dynamic floating structures like bridges and stages. Which is a collaboration between AMS Institute and MIT.

Where most of the previous projects were focussed around developing a vessel which has to operate in the current environment. Does the smart shipping challenge (SMASH) focus on combining technological developments within different parts of the inland shipping industry in the Netherlands. This will help to steer ships remotely, enable intelligent exchange of information and optimization of waterway maintenance.
Good examples are the new vessels from Nedcargo, the Gouwenaar 2 and 3. These vessels will be able to transport more containers, while reducing the fuel consumption. This will not only be acquired by improving the hull shape and machinery, but also by sailing smarter. For example by optimizing the speed, based on opening times for bridges and availability of the quay \cite{SMASH2017}.
