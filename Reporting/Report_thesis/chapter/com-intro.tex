In the previous part a model is developed which shows when decisions should be made to ensure an unimpeded voyage. This however does not take new systems into account which will be developed most likely for unmanned vessels. The first step towards theses new systems should be to determine which information these systems should supply. This is done by making variations on the messages shared between the different vessels. For example by sharing the planned path and possible decisions.

Similar steps compared to the previous part will be taken, where scenarios will be defined. These scenarios are tested to find out which strategies ships will have to cope with specific situations. Which will eventually result in an advice which information should be shared. This can be used as a starting point to develop new equipment for unmanned vessels.
