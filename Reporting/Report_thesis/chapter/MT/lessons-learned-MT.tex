\chapter{Conclusion}
The model developed in this part will start with a sensory information on a situation, it will classify this situation and make a decision based on the evaluation of criteria. The result is an advise to execute a specific strategy, or if the model can't evaluate criteria sufficiently a subset of possible strategies and the remark it needs more information to narrow it down further.
