\chapter{Result}
Summarize results of verification and validation and if it can be used in the next step. Thereby also explaining which strategies could be communicated to pilots, seafarers and traffic controllers. To make shipping safer. But on the other hand also show where it lacks support.

\section{Lessons learned}
The model developed in this part will start with a sensory information on a situation, it will classify this situation and make a decision based on the evaluation of criteria. The result is an advise to execute a specific strategy, or if the model can't evaluate criteria sufficiently a subset of possible strategies and the remark it needs more information to narrow it down further.
